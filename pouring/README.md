Imagine that you have an histogram stored in an array. Now imagine
that you can pour water on top of your histogram. Describe an
algorithm that computes the amount of water that remains trapped among
the columns of the graph. Clearly on the edges the water would fall
off. Use the language or the pseudocode you prefer.
